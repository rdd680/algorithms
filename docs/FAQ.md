# FAQ

- Why won't my code compile?
  - Checklist:
    - Are all the expected methods declared and defined?
    - Do you have `doctest.h` in your `source` folder?
    - Are you using `-std=c++11`?
    - What do the errors themselves say?
- Can I add attribute `x` to my class?
  - Yes! Any time an assignment involves a `private` section you may add anything you'd like to it.
- What libraries can I use?
  - You can use `<iostream>` and anything we build in the class repository. You may also use any helper functions you create. You may use **no** other libraries or STL objects.
